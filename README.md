# ALX Backend JavaScript Repository

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my backend JavaScript projects from the **ALX Software Engineering Program**. These projects have strengthened my understanding of modern JavaScript, backend development, and best practices in building scalable and efficient applications. The repository covers fundamental and advanced backend JavaScript concepts, including:

  * **ECMAScript 6 (ES6) Fundamentals** â€“ Exploring modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and more.
  * **Promises & Asynchronous JavaScript** â€“ Handling asynchronous operations efficiently using promises and async/await.
  * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with ES6 Classes** â€“ Implementing structured and reusable JavaScript code.
  * **Data Manipulation** â€“ Working with arrays, objects, maps, and sets to handle large-scale data efficiently.
  * **TypeScript** â€“ Introducing static typing in JavaScript to enhance maintainability and scalability.
  * **Node.js Backend Development** â€“ Understanding server-side JavaScript, working with modules, and handling asynchronous operations.
  * **Unit Testing in JavaScript** â€“ Writing effective unit tests using Jest to ensure code reliability.
